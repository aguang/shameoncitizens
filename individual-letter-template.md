# Template Letter for Divestment

Date

To Whom It May Concern: 

I am writing to  inform you that I am withdrawing all my funds from Citizens Bank, and closing my accounts. I will work tirelessly to convince others to join me in doing so until Citizens ceases investing in Sunoco Logistics and Energy Transfer Partners. Together, these companies are building the Dakota Access, Bayou Bridge, Mariner East, and Trans-Pecos pipelines. I refuse to be silent in participating in your decision to fund environmental violence and indigenous genocide. These destructive fossil fuel projects threaten air and water quality and violates sovereignty rights for indigenous peoples. I strongly encourage you to broaden the care and integrity you reserve for your customers, shareholders, employees, and communities, to include your decisions and investing. When investment decisions affect the climate, then we all are stakeholders. When investment decisions affect drinking water, the communities of greatest importance are those that are impacted. 

I am satisfied with the service I received from Citizens, and I would welcome the opportunity to return as a customer. I will not do so until your actions reflect a standard of integrity that acknowledges the true impact of a financial institution. 

Sincerely, 
___________
