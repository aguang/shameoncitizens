## Why?

Citizens Bank is funding Sunoco Logistics, which is building not only the Dakota Access Pipeline, but also the Mariner East, the Trans-Pecos Pipeline, and the Bayou Bridge Pipeline. We want Citizens to divest from Sunoco and stop doing business with them and other fracked-gas extraction companies in the future.

Stand up for indigenous sovereignty rights & the climate!
