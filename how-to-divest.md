## How to Divest

There are a couple things that it is recommended before going in to close your account (although these things don't apply to all people): 

*	Ending all direct deposits to your Citizens account
*	Ending all automatic withdraws from your Citizens account
*	Open up a new account at a credit union or a local bank

## Taking Further Action

### Publically Closing Your Account

Once you're ready to close your account, if you are interested in also doing so publically and making a statement, #ShameOnCitizens would be happy to meet you at a (RI-based) Citizens Branch with a few supporters on a day of your choosing. Our vision is that we would accompany you to the bank with #ShameOnCitizens signs, and then if you are up for it make a quick video where we ask you why you are closing your account, which we can then post on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/shameoncitizens).

Sign up to do so here: [https://goo.gl/forms/vCSzE8SnffC1R4eb2](https://goo.gl/forms/vCSzE8SnffC1R4eb2).

### Send a Letter to Citizens

Send a letter to Citizens Bank informing them of why you are closing your account. A template letter can be found here: [Individual Letter Template](individual-letter-template).
